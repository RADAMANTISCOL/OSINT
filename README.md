What is OSINT?

Often OSINT, the acronym for Open Source INTelligence, is used as a synonym for ‘open sources’.
Technically that is not correct as data itself is not the same as ‘intelligence’. Data, like the
ownership record of an offshore entity, is just data and is meaningless without the context.
